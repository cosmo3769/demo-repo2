# Hands-on Git and GitHub

**You must follow the name convention and the task mentioned below to get your pull request merged.**

**The task assigned in the first day of the event:**

* Create a repo on your local machine using git bash terminal. Create a repo on GitHub. Connect your local repository with the repo you created on GitHub. Make some nominal changes in some file and push all your code on GitHub.

* Fork the repo https://github.com/cosmo3769/demo-repo2 to make a remote copy in your GitHub account. Clone it in your local repository. Add your file using the template we have built. The file name convention should be “your name.md”. For example: “piyush.md”. There is a link field in the template section. **In the link field you have to add the repo link you have created in the first task**. Push all your changes creating a branch. Create a “pull request” from that branch.
